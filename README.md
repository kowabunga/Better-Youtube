# Better-Youtube

My take on what a better Youtube search/video player integration would look like.

This idea came from the idea that it can be annoying to be searching videos, accidently click a video link, and the page refreshes to the video. _Especially_ if you're four years deep in your search history, for whatever reason, and you now have to start from the beginning - or whereever Youtube puts you.

# This currently supports the following functionalities:

- Searching for videos
  - Searched videos will hide themselves when video player is present, preventing over-crowding of web page.
  - Ability to click button to go see search results without having to reload page
- Paginating through said videos
- Displaying video on page without reloading and losing current search position
- Logging in with Google for the following:
  - Adding comments
  - Replying to comments
  - Liking/disliking videos
- Viewing channel of video uploader
  - Ability to paginate through all videos uploaded by said user

# Adding in due time:

- Logging in with Google for:
  - Page management
    - e.g. Video uploads, channel banner changes, etc.
