# Better-Youtube

My take on what a better Youtube search/video player integration would look like.

This idea came from the idea that it can be annoying to be searching videos, accidently click a video link, and the page refreshes to the video. _Especially_ if you're four years deep in your search history, for whatever reason, and you now have to start from the beginning - or whereever Youtube puts you.

# This currently supports the following functionalities:

- Searching for videos
  - Searched videos will hide themselves when video player is present, preventing over-crowding of web page.
  - Ability to click button to go see search results without having to reload page
- Paginating through said videos
- Displaying video on page without reloading and losing current search position

# Adding in due time:

- Numbered pagination
- Ability to get user data
  - ~~Example reason: aforementioned looking through search history~~ -Deprecated by Youtube.
- Whatever else I think of as this goes on
